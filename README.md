# Project Synopsis

------------

This project was made for the first step of an interview process for a job I applied for. It is currently the backend of a full stack project meant to be a mock-up of a messaging service using 2 Django endpoints. The project had a 5-day time constraint hence the lack of features, streamlining of data retrieval, and overall vulnerability. Over time I intend to continue adding to this project to make it more secure.


Future Project Plans:
  * Streamline message querying process
  * Add CSRF authentication
  * Profanity filter for incoming messages
  * Add a date sent field to the messages model
